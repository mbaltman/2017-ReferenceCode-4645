# 2017-Steamworks-FRC-4645
This is the code used and developed during the 2017 FRC Competition

## 2017Mecanum
This project is a basic iterative program which uses a grip generated pipeline to position a mecanum drive. 



## CommanedTest
This project is a command based program.  It has a single subsystem which makes a single motor spin,  can be used as reference when getting started with Command based programming

## Steamworks
This is a Command Based Program which controls all of the Subsystems on the robot.  It also contains 3 autonomous codes for the three starting positions, the angles that the robot turns are determined by which alliance color you are.

### Tasks left

The exact angles and distances for autonomous
SmartDashboard interface that allows the drivers to input 
  
  
  1. Their Alliance
  :angles for the gear and shooting
  2. The shooters configuration
 :distance from the boiler,
  target speed for shooting
  3. Which autonomous they want to run
  : which autonomous runs
